## g2r - A GCode to Roland RML1 converter

Roland MDX mills use a custom control language called "RML1" instead
of the more standard GCode used by industrial CNC milling
machines. This program allows you to convert standard GCode programs
into RML1 for use with your MDX-15 and MDX-20 desktop mills.
